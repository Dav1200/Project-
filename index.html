    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Ping Pong</h3>
    <p>
	   My first programming project, concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at 
    city (2021).I have created a ping pong game, where every successful defend awards the user with a point that correlates to the background. The more points you earn, the different the background colour. Music has been added in the background and ball hit sound is played at set intervals(When paddle hits the ball) . I have used many techniques such as loops conditionals and randomness which I've learnt throughout the bootcamp to help me with my project.
