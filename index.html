    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Ping Pong</h3>
    <p>
	   My first programming project, concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at 
    city (2021).I have created a ping pong game, where every successful defend awards the user with a point that correlates to the background. The more points you earn, the different the background colour. Music has been added in the background and ball hit sound is played at set intervals(When paddle hits the ball) . I have used many techniques such as loops conditionals and randomness which I've learnt throughout the bootcamp to help me with my project.

  <h3>City Game</h3>

  <p>
     During my Java term I have learnt about city engine which originally uses box2d library to simulate physics and graphics. I have used the city engine to create my game, the game features a platformer with variety of levels and upgrades it also features a final boss which is created using finite state models. Throughout the term I have learnt a lot about game development and skills required for making a professional looking game. I've also learnt about GUIs and how to make a polised GUI with a lot of functionality.
